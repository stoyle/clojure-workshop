      ; Of course it is more idiomatic using the version from clojure.string (imported as s, e.g. s/capitalize)
      (s/upper-case "second java string") => "SECOND JAVA STRING"
      ; Clojure version is more generic, because it is not bound to String. Accepts any CharacterSequence.
      ; Creating java object is simple using the new special form.
      (s/upper-case (new StringBuilder "third java string")) => "THIRD JAVA STRING"

      ; What was the method which determines character at position. (hint first __ is method name (you know...the "char at" method), and next _ is the position in the string)

      ; How about creating a string on the fly with reduce? Try writing with function literal, using the java .toUpperCase method
      (reduce #((memfn toUpperCase) (str %1 %2)) "" ["a " "simple " "sentence"]) => "A SIMPLE SENTENCE"
      ; Now, how about using comp for the same task? Composing together the function which creates strings and the .toUpperCase method
      (reduce (comp (memfn toUpperCase) str) "" ["a " "simple " "sentence"]) => "A SIMPLE SENTENCE")
